Use DemoSelect to choose what to run. Only one choice from each block should be set to true at a time.
For example, setting smallMapDemo, AStarSearch, and Linear to true will run the small map using an
A* to search with a linear heuristic.

pathfindingHwk2: Creates the window and calls the other classes. Handles the main logic.
AStar: File containing the AStar search class.
BreadCrumbs: Outputs breadcrumbs behind the boid.
DemoSelect: Used to manage what you want the program to do.
Dijkstra: File containg the Dijkstra search class.
Environment: File containing the graph for the pathfinding environment.
Kinematic: File containing the kinematic boid and steering behaviors.
LargeMap: File containing the large graph.
Pathfollowing: File containing the pathfollowing behavior we discussed in class.
SimpleMap: File containing the small graph.
